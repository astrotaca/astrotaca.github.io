# Flap Flat Panel  
*For ZWO FF65 APO and ASKAR 65PHQ*

Let’s be honest. Taking flat frames is one of those things that feels simple… until it isn’t.

You want even illumination, zero gradients, minimal setup effort, and preferably something you don’t have to duct-tape to your telescope. And don’t even get me started on holding a tablet in front of your scope at 4am while freezing your hands off. Yeah, no thanks.

So I built something better. A lightweight, motorized flat panel that mounts directly to the scope and follows a fully automated sequence.

### Supported Scopes

### Early Bird Offer

Right now, I’m looking for testers to help put the panel through real-world use. That means it’s **cheaper than it’ll ever be** — no markup, just the parts and time that went into making it.

If you’re cool with giving feedback and maybe snapping a few pics of your setup, you can grab one below:
