## Introduction

Astrophotography requires precision, and one of the most important factors to keep sharp is your focus. Even the smallest deviation can affect the quality of your images, especially when dealing with long exposures and high magnification.

The ZWO EAF (Electronic Automatic Focuser) allows you to automate this process, and with the help of **NINA (Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy)**, I’ve created a setup that focuses the telescope every time the HFR (Half Flux Radius) increases by **7%** or when there’s a **1-degree temperature change**.

Let’s dive into how I set up this system and why it works, along with some of the theory behind temperature-induced focus shifts.

## Why Automate Focusing?

Focusing is a critical element in astrophotography, and maintaining it consistently throughout a session can be a challenge. **Temperature shifts** can alter the focal length of your optical system, causing the focus to drift over time. This is especially noticeable with **refractors** or **reflectors** that don’t have temperature compensation built-in. For this reason, **automated focusing** is key to maintaining sharp focus, especially for long exposure sessions.

## The Setup

I’ve integrated the **ZWO EAF** with my telescope and set it up within NINA for **automated focus adjustments**. Here’s a breakdown of the system:

- **ZWO EAF (Electronic Automatic Focuser)**: This motorized focuser moves the focuser on your telescope, making precise adjustments with minimal physical effort.
- **NINA**: Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy software controls the ZWO EAF and handles the focusing routine.
- **HFR-Based Focusing**: Every time the **HFR** increases by **7%**, NINA triggers the ZWO EAF to adjust the focus.
- **Temperature-Triggered Focusing**: I also set NINA to initiate a re-focus every time there is a **1-degree temperature change**.

## The Theory Behind Temperature-Induced Focus Drift

Temperature changes affect the optical properties of your telescope. As the temperature drops, **materials expand or contract**, which can cause the focal length to shift. For example, **metal components** like your telescope’s tube and focuser can contract in colder temperatures, which makes the focus point shift. This is why, over the course of a long imaging session, you might notice that the stars gradually lose sharpness as the temperature decreases.

The **ZWO EAF** compensates for this by moving the focuser in very small increments based on temperature changes. By incorporating **NINA**, you can set **trigger points** where the software will refocus based on **temperature variations** and **HFR changes**.

The **HFR** (Half Flux Radius) is a measure of star size in your image, and it’s often used to gauge the accuracy of your focus. A rise in HFR indicates a defocus, which could be due to a variety of factors, such as temperature changes or mechanical issues with the focuser.

### Why 7% HFR and 1 Degree?

The **7% HFR increase** is a sensitivity setting I use based on my setup’s characteristics. This value is high enough to ensure that a significant defocus is addressed but low enough to avoid unnecessary adjustments during slight changes in image quality. You can adjust this threshold depending on how sensitive you want your system to be.

Similarly, the **1-degree temperature change** trigger ensures that focus adjustments are made when the environment shifts enough to affect the optical system. Small shifts in temperature (e.g., 0.2-0.5°C) don’t usually warrant a refocus, but a 1-degree change is often enough to impact focus significantly, especially in colder conditions.

## Setting It Up in NINA

Here’s how you can configure the **ZWO EAF** with **NINA** for automated focusing:

1. **Connect the ZWO EAF to NINA**  
   Ensure that your ZWO EAF is properly connected to NINA via the **ASCOM driver**. Once connected, the EAF should appear under the **Focuser** tab in NINA’s hardware panel.

2. **Configure Temperature-Based Focus Adjustments**  
   - In **NINA**, go to the **Focusing** section of the settings and select **Temperature**.
   - Set the **temperature delta** trigger (e.g., 1°C) to initiate a focus run whenever the temperature changes by this threshold.

3. **HFR-Based Focus Adjustments**  
   - Under **Focusing** settings in NINA, enable **HFR focusing** and set the **percentage** threshold (e.g., 7%).
   - This will instruct NINA to monitor the HFR and trigger a focus when the specified increase occurs.

4. **Start Focusing Routine**  
   With these settings, NINA will monitor both temperature shifts and HFR increases during your imaging session, adjusting the focus when necessary.

## Benefits of the Setup

- **Precision**: The ZWO EAF provides high-precision focusing, eliminating manual adjustments.
- **Temperature Compensation**: Automated temperature-based refocusing helps maintain sharp focus as environmental conditions change.
- **Efficiency**: Using NINA’s automated focus routine saves time and effort, especially for long exposure sessions or remote operations.
- **Consistency**: The HFR-based focusing ensures that your stars stay as sharp as possible throughout your session, regardless of minor environmental changes.

## Conclusion

By setting up the **ZWO EAF** with **NINA**, I’ve created a streamlined workflow for automated focusing during astrophotography sessions. Temperature-based adjustments and HFR monitoring ensure that my focus remains consistent and sharp throughout the night, without the need for constant manual intervention. This setup is ideal for anyone who wants to reduce setup time and improve image quality with minimal effort.

If you’re looking to improve your focusing routine, this guide should help you get started with automated focusing using the **ZWO EAF** and **NINA**. Feel free to adapt the settings to suit your own gear and preferences!
