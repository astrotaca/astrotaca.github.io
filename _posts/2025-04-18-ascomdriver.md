# Making a Custom ASCOM Driver for NINA

When I designed the flap flat panel, I wanted it to feel like part of my imaging rig, not an accessory I had to manually manage every session. No clunky third-party tools, no command-line utilities, no external GUIs just to flip a panel open.

It had to work directly inside NINA, as if it were any other piece of imaging gear.  
So I built my own ASCOM driver.

This post isn’t a how-to. I’m not handing out the code. But if you’re thinking about building your own ASCOM device or you’re just curious how it all fits together, this will give you a solid idea of what’s involved.

## Why Not Just Use a Standalone App?

Short answer: automation.

Sure, I *could* have written a quick Python app to flip the flat panel. I actually did, early on, just to test the mechanism. But that doesn’t scale.

I didn’t want to run extra software or click separate buttons when capturing calibration frames. I wanted it to behave like a native device, recognized by NINA, controllable from the sequencer, and compatible with ASCOM’s flat panel interface.

Anything less would be friction.

## What the Driver Actually Does

At a high level, the ASCOM driver is just a middleman. It listens to NINA (or any ASCOM host), translates requests into serial commands, sends them to the microcontroller, and returns status info back to the imaging software.

The basics are simple:  
- Turn panel on/off  
- Adjust brightness (PWM)  
- Open/Close panel
- Report state (is it open? is it lit?)  

But making it feel *seamless* required a lot more thought.

## Handling Communication

You can’t just fire off serial commands and hope they land. Imaging software expects real-time feedback. It wants to know if the device is connected, if the light is on, what the brightness level is, and whether the command succeeded.

So the driver had to maintain a live connection, confirm receipt of each instruction, and gracefully handle disconnects or timeouts—especially since USB ports can be unreliable mid-session.

## Going Beyond ASCOM

ASCOM is great for standardization, but it’s not magic. It won’t auto-detect your baud rate, parse custom commands, or debug serial issues for you. And it won’t implement any actual logic for how your hardware works.

That part’s all on you.

Things like:  
- What happens if you try to dim the panel before it's flipped open?  
- What if the user sends a flip command while the servo’s still moving?  
- What’s the fallback if communication drops mid-sequence?  

You need to anticipate all of it. ASCOM is the interface, not the brain.

## Debugging and Integration

Once the driver was functional, the next step was real-world testing. That meant:

- Running calibration sequences in NINA  
- Testing behavior after sleep/wake cycles  
- Unplugging/replugging the USB mid-session  
- Capturing flats with different exposure times and checking for PWM banding

---

## The Result

Now when I start a session, the flap flat panel shows up just like any commercial flat box. NINA can flip it open, light it up, capture flats, and park it—all automatically.

There’s no extra apps running, no manual switches, and no interruptions in my workflow.

It just works. Like it should.

## Why This Matters

If you're building astrophotography hardware and want to sell it—or even just use it yourself without headaches—tight integration is a big deal.

Most people won’t tolerate anything they can’t control from their main imaging software. And most imagers *definitely* don’t want more windows, scripts, or complexity.

A proper ASCOM driver makes your hardware feel native. And when done right, it makes your gear way more usable—and way more appealing to others.

## Want One?

The flap flat panel is still in testing, but it’s coming soon.  
It’ll ship ready to go with USB-C for DATA transfer from the mini pc, a 12v DC for power, automated ASCOM control, and all the hardware you need to get clean flats.

Stay tuned.
