# Setting Up a Mini PC for Astrophotography

In astrophotography, setup time is everything. The longer it takes to get everything running, the fewer clear skies you can actually capture. I used to rely on the typical "AstroBackyard" setup with a laptop, but over time, I realized I needed something more efficient and stable. 

After some thought and trial, I moved to using a mini PC mounted directly on my telescope setup, and it's been a major upgrade. Here's how I set it up, and why I think it's an excellent solution for anyone looking to streamline their astrophotography workflow.

## Why I Chose a Mini PC

You’ve probably tried the standard laptop-on-a-plastic-box setup, right? It's functional but not ideal. I wanted something that could be mounted directly on my telescope, something that could handle all the software I use (NINA, PHD2, ASCOM drivers) without a hitch, and one that would minimize setup time for those precious clear nights.

After some research, I decided to go with the **Beelink S12 Pro** mini PC. Here's why:

- **Compact & Powerful**: With an Intel N100 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 500GB SSD, it offers more than enough power to run everything smoothly.
- **Active Cooling**: No more overheating during long imaging sessions. The mini PC has built-in active cooling to keep everything running at optimal temperatures.
- **Windows 11**: This means I can run all my astrophotography software natively without compatibility issues, unlike with Raspberry Pi or Linux-based solutions.
- **Low Power Consumption**: It runs on a fraction of the power a full-size laptop would require, reducing the load on my setup.

## The Setup: How Everything Connects

The beauty of this system is its simplicity. No more sprawling USB hubs or tangled cables. Here’s how I’ve set it up:

1. **Mounting**: The Beelink S12 Pro mini PC is mounted directly on top of the OTA (optical tube assembly) of my telescope. I designed and 3D-printed a custom bracket that holds it in place, making sure it’s secure and doesn't interfere with the telescope’s movement. The mini PC’s small form factor keeps the weight balanced.

2. **Power**: The mini PC is powered via a standard AC extension cord. Winter nights in Norway can dip to -20°C, and relying on battery power in those conditions is not an option. Having a stable power supply ensures that I won’t run into power issues during long imaging sessions.

3. **Networking**: To make sure the mini PC is fully accessible, even when I'm out in the field with no internet connection, I use a **GL.iNet GL-SFT1200** router. This router creates a local network between the mini PC and my phone or laptop, allowing me to remote control the PC from anywhere within range, even if there’s no internet access.

4. **Remote Control**: I use **AnyDesk** for remote control, which is installed on both the mini PC and my phone or laptop. This means I can set up and monitor the entire imaging session from a comfortable distance, without needing to be right next to the equipment.

5. **Storage**: With 500GB of SSD storage, I store all my astrophotography data directly on the mini PC. For easy file transfer, I’ve set up a **network-shared folder** that syncs with my main PC once I’m back home. This way, I don’t need to rely on SD cards or external drives to move files around.

## The Benefits: Why This Setup Works

Here’s why this setup is so effective:

### 1. **Reduced Setup Time**
   Once the mini PC is mounted and powered on, it’s ready to go. I no longer have to deal with USB hubs or constantly reconnecting devices. Everything is already set up and ready to communicate with each other.

### 2. **Reliable Remote Control**
   The GL.iNet router creates a local network that works even without internet. As long as the mini PC is powered and connected to the router, I can control the entire setup from my phone or laptop. This allows me to be at a distance (or even inside) while still managing the session.

### 3. **Stable Power Supply**
   No more worrying about battery drain, especially in cold weather. The mini PC is connected to the same power supply as the rest of the equipment, ensuring consistent power throughout the night.

### 4. **Compact and Clean Setup**
   With the mini PC mounted directly on the OTA, I don't have cables running everywhere or a bulky laptop in the way. The setup is more compact and streamlined, leaving me with fewer things to worry about.

## Considerations

### 1. **Weight and Balance**
   Mounting the mini PC on the OTA has worked perfectly in terms of weight distribution. However, it’s crucial to ensure the added weight doesn’t affect the balance of your setup. I did a balance test before finalizing the mount, and it’s been rock solid ever since.

### 2. **Power Requirements**
   Running a mini PC from a standard AC outlet is fine, but it’s important to ensure you have a power source within range. For those with a more mobile setup, consider using a portable power station or generator.

## Final Thoughts

Using a mini PC for astrophotography is a solid upgrade for anyone looking to improve their imaging setup. It cuts down on the clutter, reduces setup time, and provides a more stable and reliable platform for remote control. With the right mounting, networking, and power setup, it’s an easy way to make your astrophotography workflow more efficient.

If you’re tired of dealing with USB hubs, unreliable laptops, or bulky setups, I highly recommend giving this approach a try. It’s streamlined, efficient, and, most importantly, it just works.
